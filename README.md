# Lightning Meetup Proposal

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create an welcoming space where anyone can get up and talk about something related to JavaScript. The topic can be any skill level but should be accessible.

There is no expectation that talks be well-rounded and complete. The hope is that this be more of a forum for exploration and learning.

## Format

Each talk will have a 15 minute window for talking and questions.

Talks can be in any format (i.e. lecture, live code, long winded ramble, etc.)

Up to three talks will be booked. If there is time and interest more talks can be added on a first-come, first-served basis.

## Tech

In order to keep the transition between presentations to a minimum each presentations will be staged on the same machine.

As a result of this, any resources needed for the presentation should be publicly available online before the event.

## Inspiration

Here some of ideas of how people can participate. A lot of these are based on feedback from the group.

### Practice talking to a group

When I used this as an example it was based on my experience and goals. This is by no means the only reason for participation.

### Exploring a discovery

Maybe you have been working on something for a whila and want that chance to share your discovery. It could be a library you love or maybe something as you've been studying that you'd like to share.

### Sharing a project

Share anything you've been working on. Complete or not, it doesn't matter. Maybe you'll find somebody who wants to help you out. Or maybe people will have ideas to contribute.

### Find somebody to help you out

This is the same as above, but I thought of it while typing. It's important to point out that this isn't a recruiting event, but there is currently no policy against trying to find somebody to join your team.

### Process, team building or ways of working

Do you practice pair programming at work? Any tips? Want to lead a (short) mob programming session?

### Developer life skills

Maybe you have some tips on working remotely? Or maybe you like standing desks? I think ask long as you say the word "JavaScript" during a talk like this it fits under the umbrella. :)

### Asking a question

Is there something that has stumped you for a while? Or maybe you just need want to pick the brains of the entire group while standing in front of a screen. You only have 15 minutes, but why not give it a shot?
